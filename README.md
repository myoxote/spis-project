Made for UCSD SPIS 2023
Plorbo is a "Machine Learning" model that attempts to use CNN to determine whether an image is a painting or a photo.
Unfortuantely, it does not work as intended.

Unfounded speculation: the reason for this is due to how the data is formatted.

Thank you for enjoying Plorbo.
